# Stock-Market-Optimisiation-using-PPO-DRL-

The study explores how PPO agents trained on different neural architectures (MLP, CNN, and RNN) can make intelligent portfolio allocation decisions across a basket of seven technology stocks. Results show that DRL-based agents can outperform passive investment benchmarks like the Buy-and-Hold strategy.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Implement and evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for portfolio management.

Compare MLP, CNN, and RNN architectures for policy and value function approximation.

Benchmark PPO performance against:

A Buy-and-Hold strategy.

A supervised learning baseline (MLP).

Assess performance using Monte Carlo simulations to measure stability and riskâ€“reward trade-offs.
